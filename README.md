##Technologies Used* Framework: Spring Boot* Language: Java* Build Tool: Maven##Data FlowThe Todo App application follows a structured data flow pattern to handle requests and manage data efficiently:##ControllerHandles incoming HTTP requests.Defines API endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting todo items.Delegates requests to the appropriate services.##ServicesManages core business logic and data processing for todo items.Interacts with an in-memory list to retrieve and store data.Validates input data and performs necessary operations before returning results to the Controller.Handles operations like adding todos, updating todo status, and removing todos.##RepositoryThere's no explicit repository in this project, as it operates on an in-memory list of todo items.##Database DesignThis project does not use a traditional database; it uses an in-memory list to simulate data storage.##Data Structure The primary data structure used in this project is a list (ArrayList) to store and manage todo items.The Todo class defines the structure of a todo item, with fields for todoId, todoName, and todoStatus.##Project SummaryThe Todo App is a simple application built using Spring Boot and Java. It provides a RESTful API for managing todo items, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting todos. The project does not involve a traditional database; instead, it uses an in-memory list to store and manage todo items.
